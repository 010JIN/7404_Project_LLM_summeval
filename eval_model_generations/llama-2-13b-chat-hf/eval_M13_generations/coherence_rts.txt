For example, there is no transition between the first and second sentences, and the second sentence seems to be a standalone statement.\n* Additionally, the summary could benefit from more descriptive language to help paint a picture of the scene in the reader's mind. For example, instead of simply stating that the guard \"slipped,\" the summary could describe the guard's movements and the sounds of the slip to create a more vivid image.\n\nOverall, the summary is clear and concise, but it could benefit from more coherence and transitional phrases to make it flow smoothly."}
