Sentence structure: The summary consists of short, simple sentences that are easy to follow. However, some of the sentences could be tightened up to improve their flow.\n2.

For example, \"fanatical obsession\" is a bit of an overstatement, and \"non-contact offences\" could be simplified to \"indecent images of children.\"\n3. Punctuation: The summary could benefit from more punctuation to help guide the reader through the text. For example, a comma after \"Tuesday\" in the first sentence would help clarify the date.\n4.
